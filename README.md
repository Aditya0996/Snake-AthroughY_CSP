# Snake - A through Y on a 5 x 5 grid
You are given a 5 x 5 grid, and this grid should hold the letters A through Y.  Some of the cells in the grid are already filled out.  The others can go anywhere, but the constraint is that adjacent letters (for example F and G) must be adjacent to each other, either horizontally or vertically.  

|_ _ _ _ Y|

|R A _ _ _|

|_ _ _ _ _|

|_ E _ _ _|

|K _ _ _ _|
